# A Tale About A Little Breakpoint That Stuck A Huge Application

TBD: image

This is a story about a strange issuse I had when I worked with visual studio 2005 (yes, it was long long ago).I assume it can happen in any IDE.

I was working on a WinForms application (Did I say it was long time ago?). I ran the application in Debug mode and it seems to be stuck. Then I ran the application without debug mode, it seems fine. Weird...ðŸ¤”

Appearntly I added a conditional breakpoint somewhere deep in the infra code which occurs a lot of times. This caused such slowness that it seems like the application is stuck.I guess the condition I set also took a lot of time to evaluate. 

This breakpoint wasn't even related to the task I was working on, but it was left  there from the previous task.

So this is another reason to start fresh a new task: delete obsolete breakpints and bookmarks.
If you start a new task without any bookmarks and breapoints, you can utilze these tools better in order to ease code navigation and debugging.Think about how annoying it is to start debug a scenario and keep deleting old breakpoints until you finnaly reach the code you actually want to debug. [Intelij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-tasks-and-context.html#work-with-context) for example can handle this for you. 

Did you encontred this problem before? I love to hear about other strange problems you encontered.
